Using Vim in compatible mode means using vi defaults for all options, opposed to Vim defaults. As long as you didn't create a user vimrc yet or started Vim with vim -N, compatible mode is assumed! Don't use Vim in compatible mode. Just don't.

One last advice: Please learn how to use Vim properly before starting to add all kinds of hyped plugins that only implement features that Vim already supports natively.
